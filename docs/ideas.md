
### Motivations / Ideas for the language?

- Can be both scripted and compiled
  - Will first do interpreted / scripted
- STD library is big / covers a lot of ground
- Use ideas from functional languages
  - Ex, Maybe, Either, Monoid, Foldable, etc
- NOOOO CLASSES
- functions only
- inferred typing (maybe try bidirectional?)
- should feel fluid to type and read
